# CoA class tooltip conformance

Python 3.11+ standard library only. Tools that check, per class, that spells behave as their client tooltip says.
Expected values come from the effective client DBC set (`/srv/coa/server-data/dbc`), never from server code.

## Modules

- `mitigation.py`: expected armor and partial-resist mitigation of a target.
- `classes.py`: `class_spells(dbc_dir, class_id, progression_header, level=60)` lists a CoA class's spells as
  `ClassSpell(spell_id, name, ranks, max_rank, required_level, passive)`.
- `tooltip.py`: `read_tooltip(dbc, spell_id, caster)` evaluates a spell's `Description[enUS]` with the caster's
  measured `CasterStats` and returns `Readout(values, unreadable)`.
- `profile.py`: the reference character of a class file and `base_steps(class_file)`, the steps every scenario starts
  with. Its name shadows the standard library `profile`: run the package from its own directory.
- `values.py`: `value_scenario(class_file, spell, rank_id)` returns the no-combat scenario of one rank and its
  `Expectation` list.
- `hits.py`: `hit_scenario(class_file, spell, casts)` and `melee_scenario(class_file, swings)` return the hit scenario
  of a spell's highest rank and the auto-attack scenario, with their `Expectation` lists; `expected_hit` and
  `casts_needed` give the expected mean, its sigma and the number of casts.
- `classes/<name>.json`: one class file per class (`classes/templar.json`).

## Spell set of a class

- `CharacterAdvancementClassTypes.dbc` maps a class to its ClassType rows (`ClassID` matches and `CustomClass` is 1).
  ClassType is not ClassID: Templar is ClassID 19 and ClassType 21. Non-custom types, such as the shared ClassType 12,
  are never read for a CoA class.
- Every non-zero `RankSpell[0..4]` of the `CharacterAdvancement.dbc` rows of those types is one spell id (Templar: 172).
- `ranks` is the spell id followed by the spells that `src/server/coa/AscensionSpellProgressionData.h` chains to it
  (`{ClassId, FirstSpellId, SpellId, RequiredLevel}`); `max_rank` is the last rank whose required level is at most
  `level`. `required_level` is the `CharacterAdvancement` required level of the entry that holds the spell.
- `passive` is attribute bit 0x40 of the `Spell.dbc` record.

## Tooltip reading

The rules follow the stock 3.3.5a client parser (wowdecomp `WoW/Source/Ui/QuestTextParser.cpp` and `MathState.cpp`,
evidence rather than authority). Each value is `Displayed(text, value, effect_index, kind)`: `text` is the token as
written in the DBC, `value` the number before any player modifier.

| Token | Value | Kind |
|---|---|---|
| `$sN`, `$<id>sN` | `EffectBasePoints + 1`, unsigned, only if `EffectDieSides` is 1 | `percent` before `%`, or `flat` |
| `$mN`, `$MN` (with `<id>`) | `EffectBasePoints + 1`, `EffectBasePoints + EffectDieSides`, unsigned | as `$sN` |
| `$/N;` then `$sN`/`$mN`/`$MN` | divided by N; `$/1000;` followed by `sec` stays in ms | `duration_ms` or as `$sN` |
| `$d`, `$<id>d` | `SpellDuration` `Duration`, capped by `MaxDuration` | `duration_ms` |
| `$h`, `$<id>h` | `ProcChance` | `chance_pct` |
| `$u`, `$i` (with `<id>`) | `StackAmount`, `MaxAffectedTargets` | `count` |
| `$aN` (with `<id>`) | `SpellRadius` radius of effect N | `flat` |
| `${...}` | `+ - * /`, parentheses and the variables below | as `$sN` |
| `$<name>` | a `SpellDescriptionVariables` formula of the described spell | as `$sN` |

Inside `${...}`: `$mN`/`$MN` (signed), `$h $u $i`, `$d` in seconds, `$aN`, each with an optional spell id; `$AP`,
`$RAP`, `$PL`; `$SP` is the lowest spell power of schools 1 to 6, `$sph $spfi $spn $spfr $sps $spa` one school each;
`$STR $AGI $STA $INT $SPI` the effective stats 0 to 4; `$<name>` a variable defined earlier.
`effect_index` is the effect of the first `$sN`/`$mN`/`$MN` of the spell itself in the token (for `$<name>`, in its
formula), otherwise `None`. The client reads `$D $H $U $I $AN` as their lowercase forms, and so does the reader.
Color codes `|c........` and `|r` are removed, in either case.

Everything else goes to `unreadable` verbatim and is never guessed: `$?` conditionals, `@...@` markup, other `|`
escapes, other tokens (`$t`, `$o`, `$x`, `$S`, `$l`, `$g`...), expression functions and variables such as `$BH`,
`$ppl1` or lowercase `$ap`, points that scale with level (`EffectRealPointsPerLevel` or `DurationPerLevel` not
zero), spread values (`EffectDieSides` not 1 for `$sN`), missing records, non-positive durations, a `$<name>` that
the described spell's `SpellDescriptionVariableID` does not define, and a stat or school missing from `CasterStats`.

A level-scaled entry names its field, for example `${$m1+0} [EffectRealPointsPerLevel[0] of spell 706323]`. The
client does not scale by the character level: `Spell_C_GetSpellLevel` divides by 5 the rank that
`CGPlayer_C::GetSpellRank` returns. That rank is the player's skill value in the spell's `SkillLineAbility` skill
line (or weapon skill), capped at 5 × `MaxLevel`, and 0 when the spell has no ability row. `CasterStats` holds no
skill values, so these values stay unreadable.

## Reference character

`classes/<name>.json` holds `class_id`, `name`, `race`, `level`, `weapon` (`item`, equipment `slot`, 15 is the main
hand), `ratings` (fixture hit and expertise ratings, so that an aura or hit is never lost to a miss; they do not change
a tooltip value), `reference_stats`, `known_auras`, `probe_auras` and the sections `procs`, `talent_modifiers`,
`rotation`, `stack` that later tasks fill. The Templar reference is a human with the Walking Stick (item 2495).

`weapon` also freezes the `item_template` row of the weapon: `min_damage` (`dmg_min1`), `max_damage` (`dmg_max1`),
`speed_ms` (`delay`), `inventory_type` and `normalized_speed`, the speed `Unit::GetAPMultiplier` uses for normalized
weapon damage (3.3 for a two-handed weapon, inventory type 17). Walking Stick, read on 2026-11-05 from `acore_world`
in the in-RAM test database with `SELECT dmg_min1, dmg_max1, delay, InventoryType FROM item_template WHERE entry =
2495`: 6.5625, 10.9375, 2500, 17. With 313 attack power, 6.5625 + 313 / 14 x 2.5 = 62.455 is the measured
`weapon_damage_min`. `reference_stats` holds the `base_steps` values measured on the naked reference character (Templar:
2026-11-05, `.cache/verify-all/20261105-181206`); they size the scenarios, and the comparison uses the values measured
in the run.

`base_steps` waits 5 s, adds and equips the weapon, then measures with the extreme bounds of an exploratory
measurement (the judgement is made by the comparison, never by the scenario): `attack_power`,
`ranged_attack_power`, `spell_power 1`..`6`, `stat 0`..`4`, `weapon_damage_min`, and one `aura` per entry of
`known_auras` (label `known_aura <id>`) and of `probe_auras` (label `probe_aura <id>`). `caster_stats_from(measured,
level)` rebuilds the `CasterStats` that `read_tooltip` needs from those labelled values.

A naked level-60 Templar knows no class spell and carries one class aura: measured on 2026-11-05 on the worldserver of
the worktree, `knows_spell` is 0 for all 221 spell ids of the class and `aura` is 1 only for the class tuning aura
887007 (887043/887044/887045, the spec auras, and the passive Scourgebane 92111 read 0). `known_auras` therefore lists 887007
only; Scourgebane is in `probe_auras`, which is measured and reported but never explains a deviation.

## No-combat scenario of a rank

`value_scenario` returns a schema 1 scenario of one rank and its `Expectation(label, check, spell_id, rank_id,
effect_index, displayed, rule)` list. `label` is also the label of the measurement step, and is unique in the scenario.
`displayed` is the token as written in the DBC: the comparison reads the tooltip again with the measured caster
stats, since the value depends on them. The scenario learns the rank, then measures (assertions with extreme bounds):

| `check` | Measurement | Expected from |
|---|---|---|
| `effect_value` | `spell_effect_value` of the token's effect | the tooltip token (`rule` `read <kind>`) |
| `power_cost` | `spell_power_cost` before any cast | `ManaCost` divided by the client display divisor of the power type (1, 10 rage and runic power, 1000 happiness) |
| `cooldown_ms` | `cooldown_ms` right after the cast | `max(RecoveryTime, CategoryRecoveryTime)`, as the client tooltip |
| `aura_amount` | `aura_amount` of the effect after the cast | the same tooltip token as `effect_value`, for an effect that applies an aura |
| `aura_duration_ms` | `aura_duration_ms` after the cast | the `$d` token of the rank, for an instant spell that applies an aura |
| `known_aura` | `aura` before any learn | the class file; the aura's own tooltip gives its modifier |

The cast, when a cooldown or an aura is measured, targets the fixture creature `dummy` (entry 36) when an active
effect has an enemy target (implicit targets 2, 6, 15, 16, 24) and the caster otherwise; an aura whose target is the
caster is read on the caster. A cost in a power other than mana is set to its cost before the cast. Two diagnostic
measurements ride along without an `Expectation`: `<rank> cast_failure` and `<rank> aura_present`.
The remaining aura duration is read in the cast step's own tick: measured 12 to 15 ms below the record on instants.
`cooldown_ms` is the remaining cooldown, measured 6 ms below the record right after the cast.

A value that cannot be compared is never dropped; its `rule` starts with a stable prefix:
`unreadable: <entry>` for a part the reader could not evaluate (the scenario measures the spell's first active effect
beside it, which is not the token's own effect), `unreadable: tooltip without value` for an empty readout,
`unreadable: ManaCostPercentage ...` or `unreadable: ManaCostPerlevel ...` for a cost the DBC alone does not give, and
`unmeasurable: <reason>` for a readable token with no no-combat metric (other spell's effect, radius, stack or chance
token, an aura of a passive or cast-time spell). Only `unmeasurable` expectations may lack a measurement step.

## Max-rank hit scenarios

`hit_scenario(class_file, spell, casts)` models the spell's highest rank from its effects, its tooltip read with the
reference stats, the known auras and the reference target. It learns the rank, measures the target, then repeats
`casts` times: `set_power` to the cost (when the cost is a plain `ManaCost`), `reset_cooldown`, `cast`, and a wait of
`max(StartRecoveryTime, cast time, duration of a periodic aura) + 500 ms`; a 3 s drain precedes the measurements.

| `kind` | Effects | Hit before modifiers |
|---|---|---|
| `weapon` | 31 percent, 17/58/121 flat | roll times the percent, truncated, plus the floored flats (ADR 0010) |
| `school` | 2 | the floored tooltip value of each effect, or each integer from `$mN` to `$MN` |
| `heal` | 10 | as `school`, on the caster, without mitigation |
| `periodic_damage`, `periodic_heal` | 6, aura 3 or 8 | one tick; `hits_per_cast` is `Duration / EffectAmplitude` |

The weapon roll is `urand(floor(min + AP / 14 x speed), floor(max + AP / 14 x speed))` (`Unit::CalculateDamage`),
with the normalized speed when an effect is 121 and the weapon speed otherwise. `tooltip_mean` is the same sum without
integer steps: for Argent Blade 807268, 2.15 x ((min + max) / 2 + AP / 14 x 3.3) + (421 + 0.4725 x AP).
Each server integer step is then applied to every possible hit, never as a tolerance:

1. a known aura's modifier, `floor(hit x (100 + percent) / 100)` (`Unit::SpellDamageBonusDone`,
   `Unit::MeleeDamageBonusDone`, `Unit::SpellHealingBonusDone`): aura 341 for damage of its `EffectMiscValue`
   schools, aura 136 for healing, with the amount `SpellEffectInfo::CalcValue` gives at the class level (887007:
   -1 + int(50 x -0.4) + 1 = -20). Only the known auras whose `known_aura` measurement is 1 count, and the model lists
   them (`Modifier`) by spell and effect;
2. armor, `ceil(hit x kept)` (`Unit::CalcArmorReducedDamage`), or each partial-resist step `i` with its share,
   `hit - floor(hit x i / 10)` (`Unit::CalcAbsorbResist`), from `expected_mitigation` and its `resist_shares`.

`mean` and `sigma` are the mean and standard deviation of the resulting distribution. `casts_needed(model)` is the
Global Constraints rule: `ceil((2.576 x sigma / (0.01 x mean))^2)` hits, at least one, divided by `hits_per_cast`.

The `hit_mean` expectation carries `model`: the kind, school mask, weapon, modifiers, reference mean, sigma and casts,
and the labels of its measurements: `<label> total` and `<label> count` (`spell_damage_*` on `dummy` or
`spell_heal_*` on the caster, `critical: false`), `target armor`, `target view_level` and `target resistance <school>`.
`measured_hit_model(class_file, expectation, measured)` recomputes the model from a run's labelled values (caster
stats, known auras, armor, view level and resistances), since creature 36 spawns with armor 528 or 562. Two
diagnostics ride along: `<rank> critical_hits` and `<rank> cast_count`.

`melee_scenario(class_file, swings)` attacks `dummy` for `swings` weapon swings and measures the plain main-hand hits
(`melee_damage_total` and `melee_damage_count` with `critical`, `glancing` and `blocked` false) under `melee
melee_mean`, beside the swing, critical, glancing and blocked counts. Its model is the weapon roll at weapon speed with
the same modifier and armor steps.

A spell that fits no model is never dropped: its expectation has `check` `unmodelled` and a `rule` that starts with
`unmodelled: ` (a passive spell, no damage or healing effect, effects of several models, an effect without a readable
tooltip value, a periodic duration that is unreadable). Its scenario learns the rank and has no hit measurement. The
parts of the tooltip the reader could not evaluate become `hit_mean` expectations whose rule starts with
`unreadable: `, without a measurement. Not modelled: talent or proc modifiers, critical strikes, spell power
coefficients the tooltip does not show, and costs that are a percentage of base mana (no `set_power`).

## Run

Tests run through `verify_all` only; the `conformance` suite of `tools/check_source.py` lists them.

```sh
coa-verify --ram --stages source --base origin/main
```

The tests that read the client DBC set are skipped when `/srv/coa/server-data/dbc` does not exist; the fixture tests
always run.
