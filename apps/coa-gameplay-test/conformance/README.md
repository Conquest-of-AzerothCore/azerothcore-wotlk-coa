# CoA class tooltip conformance

Python 3.11+ standard library only. Tools that check, per class, that spells behave as their client tooltip says.
Expected values come from the effective client DBC set (`/srv/coa/server-data/dbc`), never from server code.

## Modules

- `mitigation.py`: expected armor and partial-resist mitigation of a target.
- `classes.py`: `class_spells(dbc_dir, class_id, progression_header, level=60)` lists a CoA class's spells as
  `ClassSpell(spell_id, name, ranks, max_rank, required_level, passive)`.
- `tooltip.py`: `read_tooltip(dbc, spell_id, caster)` evaluates a spell's `Description[enUS]` with the caster's
  measured `CasterStats` and returns `Readout(values, unreadable)`.

## Spell set of a class

- `CharacterAdvancementClassTypes.dbc` maps a class to its ClassType rows (`ClassID` matches and `CustomClass` is 1).
  ClassType is not ClassID: Templar is ClassID 19 and ClassType 21. Non-custom types, such as the shared ClassType 12,
  are never read for a CoA class.
- Every non-zero `RankSpell[0..4]` of the `CharacterAdvancement.dbc` rows of those types is one spell id (Templar: 172).
- `ranks` is the spell id followed by the spells that `src/server/coa/AscensionSpellProgressionData.h` chains to it
  (`{ClassId, FirstSpellId, SpellId, RequiredLevel}`); `max_rank` is the last rank whose required level is at most
  `level`. `required_level` is the `CharacterAdvancement` required level of the entry that holds the spell.
- `passive` is attribute bit 0x40 of the `Spell.dbc` record.

## Tooltip reading

The rules follow the stock 3.3.5a client parser (wowdecomp `WoW/Source/Ui/QuestTextParser.cpp` and `MathState.cpp`,
evidence rather than authority). Each value is `Displayed(text, value, effect_index, kind)`: `text` is the token as
written in the DBC, `value` the number before any player modifier.

| Token | Value | Kind |
|---|---|---|
| `$sN`, `$<id>sN` | `EffectBasePoints + 1`, unsigned, only if `EffectDieSides` is 1 | `percent` before `%`, or `flat` |
| `$mN`, `$MN` (with `<id>`) | `EffectBasePoints + 1`, `EffectBasePoints + EffectDieSides`, unsigned | as `$sN` |
| `$/N;` then `$sN`/`$mN`/`$MN` | divided by N; `$/1000;` followed by `sec` stays in ms | `duration_ms` or as `$sN` |
| `$d`, `$<id>d` | `SpellDuration` `Duration`, capped by `MaxDuration` | `duration_ms` |
| `$h`, `$<id>h` | `ProcChance` | `chance_pct` |
| `$u`, `$i` (with `<id>`) | `StackAmount`, `MaxAffectedTargets` | `count` |
| `$aN` (with `<id>`) | `SpellRadius` radius of effect N | `flat` |
| `${...}` | `+ - * /`, parentheses and the variables below | as `$sN` |
| `$<name>` | a `SpellDescriptionVariables` formula of the described spell | as `$sN` |

Inside `${...}`: `$mN`/`$MN` (signed), `$h $u $i`, `$d` in seconds, `$aN`, each with an optional spell id; `$AP`,
`$RAP`, `$PL`; `$SP` is the lowest spell power of schools 1 to 6, `$sph $spfi $spn $spfr $sps $spa` one school each;
`$STR $AGI $STA $INT $SPI` the effective stats 0 to 4; `$<name>` a variable defined earlier.
`effect_index` is the effect of the first `$sN`/`$mN`/`$MN` of the spell itself in the token (for `$<name>`, in its
formula), otherwise `None`. The client reads `$D $H $U $I $AN` as their lowercase forms, and so does the reader.
Color codes `|c........` and `|r` are removed, in either case.

Everything else goes to `unreadable` verbatim and is never guessed: `$?` conditionals, `@...@` markup, other `|`
escapes, other tokens (`$t`, `$o`, `$x`, `$S`, `$l`, `$g`...), expression functions and variables such as `$BH`,
`$ppl1` or lowercase `$ap`, points that scale with level (`EffectRealPointsPerLevel` or `DurationPerLevel` not
zero), spread values (`EffectDieSides` not 1 for `$sN`), missing records, non-positive durations, a `$<name>` that
the described spell's `SpellDescriptionVariableID` does not define, and a stat or school missing from `CasterStats`.

A level-scaled entry names its field, for example `${$m1+0} [EffectRealPointsPerLevel[0] of spell 706323]`. The
client does not scale by the character level: `Spell_C_GetSpellLevel` divides by 5 the rank that
`CGPlayer_C::GetSpellRank` returns. That rank is the player's skill value in the spell's `SkillLineAbility` skill
line (or weapon skill), capped at 5 × `MaxLevel`, and 0 when the spell has no ability row. `CasterStats` holds no
skill values, so these values stay unreadable.

## Run

Tests run through `verify_all` only; the `conformance` suite of `tools/check_source.py` lists them.

```sh
coa-verify --ram --stages source --base origin/main
```

The tests that read the client DBC set are skipped when `/srv/coa/server-data/dbc` does not exist; the fixture tests
always run.
